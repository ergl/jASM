# jARM: Java-built ARM executer, debugger and IDE #

## How? ##
This started as a project for the Programming Theory course at Complutense University of Madrid, 2014
The original idea was to do a virtual machine for executing a pseudo-asm language, but I quickly thought of implementing all of the ARM instruction set and making a quick and easy to use development environment for my Hardware Funtamentals course. 

## TODO ##
- Reimplementing the internal structure of the virtual machine following the current ARM standard
- Implementing the full ARM instruction set
- Recognizing different comments and arm delimiters
- Redesign the GUI and make it more intuitive and easy to use
