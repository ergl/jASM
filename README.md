# jARM: Java-built ARM executer, debugger and IDE

### How?
This started as a project for the Programming Theory course at Complutense University of Madrid, 2014.

The original idea was to do a virtual machine for executing a pseudo-asm language, but I quickly thought of implementing all of the ARM instruction set and making a quick and easy to use development environment for my Hardware Funtamentals course.
